# Hadoop & Spark
Some work with Hadoop, Spark & Spark2.<br/>
Using `Hortonworks Sandbox HDP 2.6.5` and [`MovieLense`](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) data samples.<br/>
While following the [`The Ultimate Hands-On Hadoop: Tame your Big Data!`](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-hands-on-hadoop-tame-your-big-data/) course - as a better way to learn & understand, migrated the Python scripts to Java.<br/>

- [`ml-100k`](./ml-100k) contains the data set.
- [`MapReduce`](./MapReduce) contains a Mapreduce scipt and Java application. 
- [`SparkJava`](./SparkJava) contains the Java based based Spark application. 
- [`Spark2`](./Spark2) contains the Spark2 version of the application.
