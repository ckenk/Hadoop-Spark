The Java version is created based on `RatingsBreakdown.py`

A MapReduce using Hadoop on Hortonworks Data Platform.

u.data contains the IMDB movie ratings in the form of 
`movie_id`\t`user_id`\t`rating_level`\t`timestamp`

This is the Java version of the Python scrip that tally up the total rating count for each rating level.
To run this extract the content of `Hadoop 2.7.3_libs` to the same location as `MapReduceJava.jar`.

Then to run
	- locally:<br>
		<pre>java -jar MapReduceJava.jar ./u.data ./<a_dir_does_not_exists><pre>
		
	- as job submitted to hadoop:<br>
		upload the `u.data` using the file browser to `maria_dev` (or the default user directory of the HDP setup.
		Then run the command:<br>
		<pre>yarn jar MapReduceJava.jar ./u.data ./map_reduce_out<pre>
	
	- The result will be generated in `map_reduce_out/part-r-00000`
